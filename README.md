# Task List Manager Application

### Project Duration: November 11, 2020 - December .., 2020

### Project Task
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aim of this project is to create a simple task list application using the MEAN tech stack and also included features such as... This project is also meant to demonstrated my understanding of CRUD operation, building an restful API, user authentication and other essential features needed in web app development. 


### Background
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the sudden COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine, my class wasn't able to get through the entire syallbus for my Full Stack MEAN Development class. Thus we were only able to make a simple Node Exprees app, Angular app, and how to use MongoDB and never got to make an app using all four software components. Thus in an effort to finish what was started, I wanted to make a project that incorporated all the technologies that I learned from this course and so I decided to make a simple to-do / task list manager app. As simple and basic as this project may seem, I believe that this project is perfect in displaying all that I've learned from CS 400 as it's application of essential features needed in any web application; more on this below.
