# Task List Manager Application

### Project Duration: November 11, 2020 - December 18, 2020

### Project Task
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aim of this project is to create a simple task list application using the MEAN tech stack. This project is also meant to demonstrated my understanding of CRUD operation, building an restful API, user authentication and other essential features needed in web app development. 


### Background
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the sudden COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine, my class wasn't able to get through the entire syallbus for my Full Stack MEAN Development class. Thus we were only able to make a simple Node Exprees app, Angular app, and how to use MongoDB and never got to make an app using all four software components. Thus in an effort to finish what was started, I wanted to make a project that incorporated all the technologies that I learned from this course and so I decided to make a simple to-do / task list manager app. As simple and basic as this project may seem, I believe that this project is perfect in displaying all that I've learned from CS 400 as it's application of essential features needed in any web application; more on this below.  

### App Demo 
#### Sign Up / Log In Feature
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the user authentication feature, the user can create an account by signing up and is automatically logged into the main app page where you can create new tasklists and new tasks.

#### Create / Read Operation Feature
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the aid of therestful API, the app is able to read in the tasklists and tasks associated with the user's account. The user can then create new tasklists by clicking the "Make a New List" button and new tasks by clicking the "+" button.
